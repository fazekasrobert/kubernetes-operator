# operator
Basic kubernetes operator built with Kubebuilder to deploy httpd.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**NOTE:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Prerequisites
Deploy `ingress-nginx` on your cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.5.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

**NOTE:** `make install` also creates a namespace, called `sandbox-system`. Each CRD should be placed in this namespace.

2. Create a sample CRD on the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/operator_sample.yaml

```

3. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

4. Delete operator and CRDs:

```sh
make uninstall
```

**NOTE:** Also, `make uninstall` deletes `sandbox-system` namespace and all of its content.

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets.
